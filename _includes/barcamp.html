This means you have the opportunity to literally stand on stage, with a microphone in your hand, maybe a slide or 2 and (at most) 5 minutes to pitch whatever you are passionate about. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            We have some goodies and give aways for those who take up on this challenge. If you are interested in pitching at the barcamp please <a href="http://goo.gl/E9bFZ4">fill in this form</a> with your barcamp topic and slides (if necessary) and we'll queue you up!<br/>
                            <br/>
