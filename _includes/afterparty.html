                        <p>A GDG DevFest is not a DevFest without a memorable after party! We were doing a little dance when <a href="http://icemobile.com">IceMobile</a> told us they'd be happy to sponsor this years after party! Cheers IceMobile! Looking forward to closing the DevFest in style at Cafe Maslow, with a beer in one hand and a bitterbal in the other.</p>

                        <h5><a target="_blank" href='http://www.maslowcafe.nl'>After Party location: Maslow</a></h5>
                        <p>We'll be partying at <a href='http://www.maslowcafe.nl'>Maslow</a>, <i>the</i> living room of Science Park, as they like to describe themselves. Located at the entrance of Science Park and having a large terras outside Maslow is the perfect place for a great party. After a full day of sessions and workshops the after party proves to be a great time to continue the discussions with new found friends having the pleasure of drinking a beer and eating a bitterbal. We'll give away a device or two as well, so we hope to see a lot of you there! The after party starts at 5pm and is supposed to end at 7pm... We'll see ;-)</p>
