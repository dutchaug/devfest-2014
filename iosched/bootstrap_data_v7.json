It is best known for modern client-side web apps, but it has a compelling server-side story, too.\r\n\r\nDart's server-side framework has been developed from scratch and offers a scalable IO API with a unified asynchronous programming model. It is exactly what you expect from a modern framework: it is simple, fast, and easy to work with. Despite its simplicity its provides excellent performance, frequently outperforming other well-known frameworks. With the upcoming support for \u201casync await\u201d in Dart writing asynchronous code becomes much simpler.\r\nDart runs on Google App Engine, has wide support for Google Services and is easy to deploy in a Docker container.

No doubt that you've seen the LG G Watch, Samsung Gear Live and Motorola Moto 360, so surely you're excited to play with them! Dive into creating an Android Wear app, and learn how you can adapt your app to appear on these cool new devices!\r\n\r\nPlease note: it's required that you bring your own Android device running Android 4.3 or higher. Not sure if your device supports Android Wear? Check: http://g.co/WearCheck on your device to find out. \r\n\r\nIf you cannot bring an Android Wear compatible device, check with a buddy that you can team up using his or hers. Some experience with Android is required. If you're familiar with setting up a project in Android Studio and building an app with notifications, you're ready to start working with Android Wear. Please install the latest Android SDK tools, platform-tools, build-tools and Android 4.4W (API 20) SDK at home, to avoid download-mania on-site!\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this workshop we will make sure that there are plenty Android Wear devices available on site to develop and test with.\r\n\r\nThis is a guided workshop with prearranged material.

I will show some optimized configurations that can help you to reduce the size of common libraries.
