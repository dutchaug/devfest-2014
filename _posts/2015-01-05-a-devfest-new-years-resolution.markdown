###A DevFest new year's resolution

The results of the survey are in! In short, *DevFest NL 2014 was a massive success.* There were still some areas to improve, and our new year's resolution is to have a bigger, better and more awesome DevFest 2015.

We're amazed to see that 92 respondents filled in the survey! I'll briefly summarize the feedback in terms of participation, venue, organization and sessions.

####Participation

> Thank you for a great day!

&mdash; Survey respondee #56

> Met some new people and learned some new things.

&mdash; Survey respondee #9

Most importantly, a whopping 97% of respondents want to come back next year, of which 78% said "certainly". The perceived value of a ticket averaged out to â‚¬16.63. Of course, in the true spirit of GDG, we always aim to keep DevFest free to attend!

We were surprised to see that two thirds were already familiar with GDGs.

The primary way people learned about the event was simply by word of mouth. We think that the enthusiasm of the community really has people talking!

####Venue

> I think it was a great location and it covered a lot of interesting topics.

&mdash; Survey respondee #76

> Amazingly organized, very smooth. Love the big conference rooms!

&mdash; Survey respondee #25

While attendees were very positive about the venue in general, we got especially good feedback about the quick and efficient registration. Kudos to Hugo and his home-brewed badge printing system!

Next year we will be sure to provide a printed program, have better signage, and hang posters illustrating where the various tracks take place.

We were of course aware that WiFi was problematic, although accommodating for so many users is extremely difficult. We'll see what can be done to improve this in the future.

####Organization

> I was very impressed with the organization and quality of the speakers.

&mdash; Survey respondee #37

> Very well organised, and a good variety of topics.

&mdash; Survey respondee #11

One of the lowest marks we received was on the selection of speakers. While still very positive, we agree that there is room to improve on this in the future. For instance, closing the call for papers sooner would have given speakers more time after being accepted to prepare their session. Also, foreign speakers that couldn't make it on such short notice would have a better opportunity to arrange their travel.

As most attendees are involved with such technologies it was unsurprising that there was a huge amount of feedback on the website (Project Zeppelin) and app (Conference Engineer)! These will of course be continuously improved in collaboration with other GDGs as general platforms, but we will be more vigilant to avoid mistakes in the program as there were this year.

It was reassuring to see that despite the extreme rush on coffee in the morning and the various problems we had with the machines, the quality made it worth the wait. Our highest mark was for the coffee, tea and snacks, and kudos to Wiebe for keeping that running smoothly throughout the day!

Lunch and the after party got very positive responses as well, although we were sorry to read that we hadn't taken dietary restrictions into account well and that some attendees couldn't find the after party venue.

####Sessions

> Throughout the talks, I learned valuable things I will definitely use in my future projects!

&mdash; Survey respondee #4

> Very well organized, very interesting speakers.

&mdash; Survey respondee #85

I won't go into detail about each session, but there are a few noteworthy conclusions from the survey.

Whereas there were still sessions leaning strongly towards "too basic" or "too advanced", averaged over all sessions, the level was marked _exactly as perfect_. We're very happy about that, as from last year the resounding feedback was to have more challenging sessions!

Feedback about the relevancy to your projects was relatively low; we'll make sure to ping the communities in the months leading up to DevFest NL 2015 to try to better understand what attendees are looking to learn.

The favorite speakers were Matt Feigal, Eric Lafortune, Martin Nauman, Ronald van der Lingen, Mischa Dasberg and Remco Vlierman.

We promised a Chromecast to one lucky participant! One has been picked and we'll announce it soon.

####Onward to 2015!

> It was a fantastic experience!!

&mdash; Survey respondee #2

If you provided feedback, thanks so much! We value it very much, and also towards Google and our other sponsors, your suggestions, criticisms and compliments will help make next year more amazing.

If you still want to provide feedback, you're very much welcome to tell us in person at one of the GDG events in the Netherlands.

Hope to see you soon!
