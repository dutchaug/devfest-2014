#### GDG DevFest NL sold out!
It's been quite a ride since registration opened on Monday September 1st at 10am. In little more than a day registration to the GDG DevFest The Netherlands 2014 is completely full! A [waitlist](http://devfestnl14.eventbrite.com) is active for those of you who couldn't get a ticket in time. If you registered and already know you can't make it please [cancel your registration](http://help.eventbrite.com/customer/en_us/portal/articles/581556) as soon as possible so the next person on the waitlist gets a chance to register.

Thanks for signing up everybody! In the mean time you can keep an eye on this website or [rss-feed]({{site.baseurl}}/feed.xml) for updates on booked speakers and the program. Or you can sign up for our GDG DevFest NL newsletter [here](http://eepurl.com/1QEgT) and we'll send you an update every two weeks until November 8th.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:info@devfest.nl)!
