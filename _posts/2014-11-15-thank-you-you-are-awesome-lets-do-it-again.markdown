###Thank you! You're awesome! Let's do it again!

####Saturday Nov 8th 2014, 9:00am
With many weeks of diligent preparations we opened up the doors of Science Park 904 for the second annual GDG DevFest The Netherlands. We were happy to welcome 260 DevFesters with a T-shirt and a cardboard (the latter for the first 200 early birds). I had the honor of opening the conference day in an opening keynote. I am in awe of a couple of things which I'd like to share with you.

####Thank you attendees!
First of all I thanked everybody in the room for just being there, on their free Saturday and all. Many travelled to Amsterdam from all across the country. Some speakers and attendees even came from countries nearby and further away. How awesome is that? Why do these DevFesters do this? Why not read a blog, or read up on a framework on-line or ask a question on Stack Overflow if you are stuck with something? Here's what I think... 

**These people did not attend our DevFest solely for the content!** You can find a blog, a book or a YouTube video to learn anything nowadays. DevFest is all about the community, meeting old friends and making new ones. Learning from each other, not via a unidirectional presentation but being part of the discussions during and after the sessions, in the various breaks and at the After Party. Exchanging contact details and staying in touch after the DevFest. We've done our best in creating a friendly environment where people could do just that. I think this comment by Jeroen Wiert Pluimers on a [G+ post](https://plus.google.com/+PaulLammertsma/posts/Xarhtyg7cr2) is one of the best complements we've got:
 
**Jeroen Wiert Pluimers: _"Thanks for organizing this. It was a great conference! A great mix of things outside my comfort zone and things I could relate to from a very different perspective: wonderful and inspiring."_**

That is exactly what we are trying to achieve with the various Google Tech meetup groups in The Netherlands. Our slogan says *"Inspire and be inspired"*. It doesn't say *"Lean back and learn from the pro's"*, no, Stand up and "Inspire" (verb) others first and be inspired by what happens next. Let me elaborate on that a bit more.

**Maybe one of those things outside Jeroen's comfort zone was taking this picture, but we're pretty happy with the result. Thanks again everybody!**

#### Everybody's got a story to tell
Finding and talking to each other is just the first step in sharing knowledge and learning new things. I still think there is a huge latent pool of knowledge which we didn't even start to tap into. Hack, a lot of people don't even know it exists. This great pool of knowledge is... Your story... I'm convinced that everybody's got a story to tell. What we are trying to do with the monthly meetups is providing our community members with a friendly environment to share their stories and knowledge with others. Every time you face a problem and solve it you have a story to tell. It's that simple. **Don't think that you are not old, wise or knowledgable enough to teach others**. If you have invested time to solve something why not share it with others so they won't walk into the same traps and make the same mistakes. Maybe it's just *the way* you solve things, or how use your IDE, or your programming style which inspires others to do things differently, better, quicker, smarter. Think about it. Did our DevFest speakers tell you mostly new stuff, or were you thinking: *"I already know that,"* or *"that's not true, I know how you can do it better"*. If you had any of those thoughts you should be on stage next year ;-) Or come to our meetup and share your stories. I'd love to hear them (For one I'm a sucker for enthusiastic people and their stories!). And even if that's too far out of your comfort zone don't [come to our meetups]((http://www.dutchaug.org)), but please start by sharing your solutions with your colleagues at work.

####Thanks to our speakers
Okay, okay, it's a bit awkward to state that you should not come to our DevFest for the content. I was trying to make a point, and the attentive reader noticed I said *"not solely"*. I'm very proud we could provide you with 20 sessions divided over 3 parallel tracks and 2 workshops. Know that the speakers don't just come to deliver their talk because they have to. We know many of them are simply passionate about their work, want to share it and simply want to meet you and hear your feedback about how you apply this stuff in your work or how they can make their framework, open source project or project a better tool for you. I'd like to thank our speakers: [Ronald van der Lingen](https://plus.google.com/+RonaldVanDerLingen) (Layar), [Carmen Popoviciu](https://plus.google.com/118143942632321563925) (ING), [Peter Verhage](https://twitter.com/petercv) (Egeniq), [Mischa Dasberg](https://plus.google.com/111302754471583092322) (JPoint), [Remco Vlierman](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=6663768) (Freelance), [Frank Schr√∂der](https://plus.google.com/107945180404729331757) (Marktplaats), [Ioannis Panagiotopoulos](https://plus.google.com/+IoannisPanagiotopoulos) (IceMobile), [Maarten Verbaarschot](https://plus.google.com/117898593926559748909) (De Voorhoede), [Jozua Sijsling](https://plus.google.com/+JozuaSijsling) (Freelance) and everybody else who submitted a sessions via our Call for Papers form (about twice as much). Thanks for your time to prepare and tell your story. Thanks for the many speakers from abroad: [Eric Lafortune](http://www.saikoa.com) (Saikoa, Belgium), [Martin Naumann](https://www.google.com/+MartinN1) (Archilogic, Switzerland), [Artem Golovin](https://plus.google.com/+ArtemGolovin) (Finland), [Wolfram Rittmeyer](https://plus.google.com/+WolframRittmeyer/posts) (Germany), [Soren Gjesse](http://dartlang.org/) (Google Denmark) and [Mandy Waite](https://google.com/+MandyWaite) (Google UK) and their companies for investing time and money to share your knowledge with us.

#### Thanks to our sponsors
Of course we'd like to thank our sponsors for believing in what we do and helping us in achieving just that. Thanks for being _community friendly_ companies, as we like to call them. I honestly think companies which support communities like ours are the coolest companies around! They value what we love to do most, building awesome mobile, web and cloud apps. First we'd like to thank Google and especially [Rupert Whitehead](https://plus.google.com/+RupertWhitehead/posts) (our GDG Manager at Google) for their support. How awesome it is that Google is supporting hundreds of DevFests worlwide, and not in a small way. Unlike last year we filled up the sponsor slots top down, instead of bottom up. We first added [Bol.com](https://banen.bol.com/vacatures/?search=true&filter-searchphrase=&filter-company-departments=it&selectItemfilter-company-departments=it) and a little later [Triple IT](https://www.triple-it.nl/jobs) as Gold Sponsors. [ING](http://www.ing.jobs/Nederland/Vakgebieden/Informatie-Technologie.htm) and [eBay Classifieds](http://www.ebayclassifiedsgroup.com/careers.html) (better known under the name Marktplaats in The Netherlands) signed up for a Silver slot and [Luminis](http://www.luminis.eu), [Qualogy](http://www.qualogy.com), [QAFE](http://www.qafe.com), [Q42](http://q42.nl) and [App Developers Alliance](http://www.appdevelopersalliance.org/) took a Bronze slot. Last years gold Sponsor [IceMobile](http://icemobile.com) filled up what is probably the coolest sponsor slot in the list and became After Party sponsor, brewing a mighty tasteful white IPA with a GDG DevFest The Netherlands 2014 label. Just... wow IceMobile!

#### Thanks to the team
Deserving a paragraph of their own is the GDG DevFest The Netherlands 2014 team. The last paragraph, the foundation, the guys who pulled it off. I'd first would like to thank my fellow [Dutch Android User Group](http://www.dutchaug.org) organizers, [Wiebe Elsinga](https://plus.google.com/+WiebeElsinga/posts), [Dennis Geurts](https://plus.google.com/113269803670398336067/posts), [Hugo Visser](https://plus.google.com/+HugoVisser/posts) and [Paul Lammertsma](https://plus.google.com/+PaulLammertsma/posts). We've been organizing monthly meetups since October 2011 and again took on the challenge of being the main organizers of GDG DevFest The Netherlands 2014. In many ways this years edition was a multitude bigger, better, easier to organize and more fun than last year. Thanks Wiebe, Dennis, Hugo and Paul for your enthusiasm, your time and effort and simply for being friends.

We had help from GDG The Netherlands, organized by [Rokesh Jankie](https://plus.google.com/+RokeshJankie/posts) (thanks for moderating the web track and the pictures Rokesh!), [Ernest Micklei](https://plus.google.com/+ErnestMicklei/posts) (thanks for your session Ernest) and [Adolfo Benedetti](https://plus.google.com/+AdolfoBenedetti) (thanks for the Polymer Workshop Adolfo!), Google Developer Expert [Kars Veling](https://plus.google.com/+KarsVeling/posts) (Q42 -- thanks for your Cloud talk and moderating the Cloud track Kars!), [Matt Feigal](https://plus.google.com/+MattFeigal/posts) (Google -- thanks for your session Matt!) and last but not least **Julian Jansen**, working at [Minor Programming](http://www.mprog.nl/cursussen/) at the UvA. Julian was our contact at the UvA and arranged many things at the venue. And what an awesome DevFest venue it was (with a lot of potential for an even bigger DevFest next year ;-). Thanks again for your and Minor's flexibility in getting this all organized Julian! Last but not least, thanks for the many extra hands we had in making this day possible and clean up in time to get to the After Party.

**TL;DR Thank you! You're awesome, don't forget that! Let's do it again next year!**

**"Do it again" by Royksopp was unofficially dubbed DevFest 2014 theme song by Hugo. We played this song during the various breaks and in between sessions ;-)**
