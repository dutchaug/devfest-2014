  bio: "Johan is a developer in heart and soul and is employed as Mobile Software Engineer at VX Company. With a strong Enterprise Java background Johan has made the switch to full time Android developer in 2011 and fell in love with his new role from day one. Johan is co-founder of The Dutch Android User Group where Android professionals can meet and share knowledge on their monthly meetups. With Android as work and hobby the rest of his time is devoured by his two daughters and son. With the slogan 'sleeping is for sissies' Johan likes to watch movies and TV shows, play a tune on the piano or guitar and sing along (the latter when no one's around) and likes to read a good book."
