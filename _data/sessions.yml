#  title: "Building Cloud-powered wearable Apps"
#  description: "Android wear extends the Android platform to a new generation of wearable devices. The user experience is designed specifically for wearables. In this session you'll see how to use the Android Wear SDK to build a connected cloud-powered application. Using Android Studio and it's cloud extensions, you'll see how to build an app that 'listens' for changes in stock prices, and notifies a wearable device. You���ll also see how to use voice controls on the device to trigger interactions with the app, such as buying or selling the stock after a notification. Call to action: Get the SDK and start building apps today!"

  title: "Fighting application size with ProGuard and beyond"
  description: "Apps are getting larger, pushed by ever increasing user expectations. Social media, maps, advertisements,... As a developer, you may add a few libraries, and before you know it, your app is exceeding the constraints of the Android platform. In this presentation, I will discuss the main problems and some solutions. ProGuard, the bytecode optimizer and obfuscator in the Android SDK, is an obvious first step. I will show some optimized configurations that can help you to reduce the size of common libraries. If ProGuard isn't sufficient, you may have to resort to more drastic techniques, such as dynamic class loading. I'll discuss some techniques and their implications. I'll also introduce the new dex splitting feature of our software DexGuard."
